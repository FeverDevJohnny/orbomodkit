# OrboModKit

Toolkit made in Unity 2022.3.4f1 that allow you to build level mods for [Orbo's Odyssey](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2539960/Orbos_Odyssey).

#### Notice

I STRONGLY recommend [learning unity's interface](https://learn.unity.com/project/start-creating-1?pathwayId=5f7bcab4edbc2a0023e9c38f&missionId=5f77cc6bedbc2a4a1dbddc46) before trying to use the modding toolset. This documentation is explicitly here to tutorialize the mod tools themselves, not the engine.

### Getting Started

To get started go to the [Docs](https://github.com/FeverDevJohnny/orbomodkit/tree/main/Docs) folder in the repos root.

### Thanks

Special thanks to Deadcows for having developed [MyBox](https://github.com/Deadcows/MyBox), which is imported via package-manager in the Orbo's Odyssey Modkit to make interfacing with the modkit objects a lot cleaner.

Another special thanks to Facepunch for the [Facepunch Steamworks API](https://github.com/Facepunch/Facepunch.Steamworks), which is what the modkit uses to send data to the steam workshop.
